      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a Customer Experience Specialist at Proximity! Basically a fancy way of saying that I'm the tech support person. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in Denver, CO. I came to the Western Slope (Grand Junction, CO) to get my degree at Colorado Mesa University. I graduated in 2017 with a Bachelor's Degree in Mass Communication.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to dance! Whether it's choreographed in a studio or just dancing at the club. I enjoy fitness, working out, and of course skiing! </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Any job that allows me to interact with other people and travel the world. Which, I pretty much already have!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Grand Junction, CO</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Never in my life did I think I would be interested in computer science, but ever since I began my career with a software start-up company my world changed! I want to have the ability to translate what's happening behind the scenes on to the front end. I believe these skills are the future!</p>
